# Day 174 of writing a smart contract a day until ETH hits $10k

**‚ùåü¶ú Solidity from the Ground Up:  Ep. 5**

So bytecode and whatnot is cool. But how does this work in the real world? How can someone go and interact with this code? Today we're going to get a picture of that.

## üõù Playground
The evm codes playground is a fake EVM that just simulates what this code does. It's not really running on the EVM. But real world smart contracts are. How does our knowledge of bytecode translate to a real person using it?

Well, if you know nothing about ETH, just know that you send transactions in ETH. You paste an address of a wallet or smart contract into you wallet like Metamask, and can send ETH to it. You can also send some data, which is how more advanced code gets called.

But for now. Let's build a handy little contract. A paywall. One that you can send some money (in ETH) to and it will either pass or fail.

Quick Disclaimer about Contracts
So there's more to contracts. And we're going to get to that eventually. They need a lot of setup work to have them deployed with their own addresses and memory and stuff.

To return to our kitchen analogy, if we're deploying a contract that's not just a recipe but also the instructions for the chef to prep the kitchen and put all its bowls and tupperware in the right places.
We are not going to tackle all that today, so we're not deploying a REAL smart contract. Just the logic that would exist within one.

So yes this is still a simulation in evm.codes, but it's the bread and butter of what's going on

## ü´ï Our Ingredients

We need some fun new opcodes to do this.
Remember to look through evm.codes to find their hex opcode as well as info on each:
1. CALLVALUE
2. EQ
3. JUMPI
4. REVERT
5. JUMPDEST
6. STOP

Lots of new stuff. Let's talk about each one:

CALLVALUE
This pushes onto the stack the "value" of your transaction. How much ETH (in wei, the smallest unit of ETH so 0.000000000000000001) that you sent.

EQ
This is =. It pushes a 1 onto the stack if the last 2 before it are equal.

JUMPI/JUMPDEST
These jump to other parts of the program. The I means that JUMPI will ONLY jump to the position on the top of the stack if the number under it is NOT 0.

Also where it jumps to has to be a JUMPDEST. This might be confusing but wait until you see the screenshot, it'll make more sense

REVERT
Fails the transaction

STOP
Ends the transaction more gracefully.

Ok easy enough we just need to get the callvalue, push the number we want it to be, see if they're equal. Then if they are jump to STOP, and if not REVERT. Ez pz.

## üö∂üèº Walkthrough

Here's the screenshot of my code. Notice I entered 5 in the box for "value" so the value in my tx is 5.
![EVM codes screenshot](<images/Screenshot from 2023-12-15 23-47-11.png>)

First we use CALLVALUE to push the received value (5) onto the stack

`5`

Then we push the value we need for the paywall (also 5) onto the stack

`
5
5
`

Then EQ returns 1 because they are equal

`1`

Then we push 08 because [08] is the index of JUMPDEST

`
8
1
`

then we JUMPI -> it sees 1 is not = 0 so it does jump to 8

STOP :)

Yay we did it. But what if we sent 4 instead of 5?

This time eq returns 0 instead of 1

And when the computer gets to JUMP1 the stack has
`
8
0
`

Because of the 0, it does not jump to 8 and instead continues to the REVERT underneath it and errors

## üôÇ For your entertainment
This is pretty much real programming you're doing now. So see what else you can build! Try out other opcodes like OR, LT, GT or AND. See if you can build a paywall that accepts overpaying for example.
Maybe just require it's not zero (ISZERO). 

Also take a look at the ADDRESS opcode. You can maybe go and make an owner only function that will only accept a tx where the right address is calling the function.

There's a lot you can do from this point. Pretty much any logic you want with the input of address or value. Sky is the limit. 

But a few questions remain to take us to the world of Yul, where we can make all of this stuff way way way easier. And that is memory.
