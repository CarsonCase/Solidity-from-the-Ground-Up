# Writing a Smart Contract a Day Until ETH Hits $10k
### A Free Course to Transform Parrots into Software Engineers

For 170 days, I've run a Twitter account where I "post a smart contract every day until someone hires me". It was a great way to stay practiced as a professional Solidity developer, and build a sort of unconventional portfolio, while also venting my frustrations with the 2023 job market. As of today, I'm moving that goalpost to ETH hitting $10k; a goal we can all share. And this change is in the spirit of wanting to do more than just post a contract for myself. The way programming is taught online is broken, and ill prepares people for an AI enabled world. This is why I'm starting a free course, with episodes publishing daily to teaching Solidity, Ethereum, and really, Computer Science in the way I wish someone taught me. From the ground up.

## ü¶ú What's wrong with coding courses?
When I first learned to code I was 13 and I was a parrot. I could intake information and remember snippets of code, and understand the parts of the snippet I had to change to customize it. I could regurgitate that memorized "system.out.println" or whatever, but I didn't understand what was going on.

Have you ever tried to learn to code? And someone tells you "start with Python!" so you google "how to code in Python" and it's easy enough. X = 5, Y = 2, X + Y = 7. Cool. But the whole thing just makes no sense. If it's all just 1s and 0s why are there words? What the heck is a terminal? And how does print() print words to it? Why can I only use a terminal? Where are windows and websites? And ok I use Django for websites but what... What is going on??

This is how it feels to "learn to code" in 2023

## ü§ñ AI is going to eat you.
If you read that last part and thought "hmm I might be a code parrot". I have some terrible news for you. Because Sam Altman has created the ultimate code parrot. Chat GPT has read every tutorial, Medium article and bootcamp on the internet. And it knows how to regurgitate memorized code snippets FAR better than you do. 

So software engineers are going to be on the streets? No. Just code parrots. Coding is to software engineers as language is to poets. If you know every syntactical rule of Python but can't THINK, you're as good as; nay, far worse than, an AI poet.

## ü§† I'm built different
Me? Personally? I'm built different. And this free course is built different. I want to teach from the ground up. I'm not going to start day 1 "deploy your first ERC20 token" where you can learn to spend 2 hours doing what ChatGPT does in half a second. I want to teach through a lens of what software engineering is all about: **creativity**, the ability to generate **novel** and **useful** ideas. To solve problems and think critically, and most importantly, **understand** what you're doing. 

In fact. We're not going to start with Solidity or smart contracts at all. And we're not going to end with it either. Because while this course teaches the EVM, it's about much more than crypto, it's about learning to think like a Software Engineer and not a parrot.

## üí∏ Why Eth development?
1. It's my bread and butter. I feel comfortable teaching it.
2. It's fun and it's cool. You can and watch a tutorial on React another time to learn how to do that. But if you're going to learn these broader concepts and ideas I want to teach, you want to do it in something that's fun and engaging.
3. You know you want it. Everyone wants to work in web3, even if you think it's a scam. This is the modern day gold rush, and trust me, it's worth it. I've worked as a professional dev in this industry, and bull market life is crazy. If you want to live a life that's a cross between Wolf of Wall Street and HBO's Silicon Valley, learn web3 development.

## ‚ùì How do I learn?
Just follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn! I'm still posting every single day. I'm posting until ETH hits 10k (then I'll probably move the goalpost to 50).

Each day I'm going to post a link to the whole course so you can start from the ground up and do them at your own pace. This link will probably change as I find better ways to display the info, but for now it will be in GitHub.

Also. Never hesitate to send me a DM with questions. I am happy to be working on this, talking with people interested in learning! And please please please give suggestions. I've never taught before, so any advice is welcome.

Finally, you don't need to be a software dev or give half a crap about computers to do this and follow along. I've been doing code puzzles for about an hour each morning with my coffee to start the day, and I literally feel smarter after only a few weeks of this habit. You want to be a smart person? Want to be someone who can solve puzzles and just be the real life equivalent of a wizard? Follow along, for not even an hour a day. I guarantee it'll be worth it.
