# Day 195 of writing a smart contract a day until ETH hits $10k

**‚ùåü¶ú Solidity from the Ground Up:  Ep. 26**

If you've ever been around in crypto, especially ETH or other smart chains, you've likely heard the term "ERC" before. Likely around ERC20 and/or ERC721 (fungible and non-fungible tokens respectively). But what IS an ERC? And why do we care for making our token?

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ ERCs

ERC stands for "Ethereum Request for Comment" and has a cousin, the EIP: "Ethereum Improvement Proposal". Based off context you might think ERC means something about tokens but really it's more like a format for a forum post. There's a website, https://eips.ethereum.org/, where people can submit these ideas, and if enough people like them, they become standards.

So ERC is for ideas regarding stuff built on top of ETH, such as a standard way to implement a token, so we can all do it the same way and make them function well together.  
  
EIP is about improvement ideas for the ETH blockchain as a whole.  

Anyways, let's take a look at the ERC20 post:  
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

Here it lists out all the functions that a token should have, and what they should do. Using this page, and our current knowledge we should be able to construct most of a token, and we'll start on that tomorrow!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Community

Community is a really important concept in the tech world, not only in blockchain. People really love this computer stuff, and many people dedicate large chunks of their lives to contributing to Open Source projects, as in, software that anyone can read and contribute to. Almost every software you can think of from phone operating systems like IOS and Android to office software to heart monitor firmware probably has an open source version out there somewhere just built by people who want to make it. And even the paid ones often use open source building blocks to put it together.  
Why am I talking about this? Well if you like this whole computer thing, you really should consider looking into communities and projects and getting involved. Not only is it just a great way to network and meet people to help along your journey but recruiters really really like to see you contributing to open source projects. The EIPs/ERCs are an example of this.  
If you wrote an ERC and it was well thought out, even if it was never really considered, but something that really comes from the heart and experience of your knowledge of the technology, a recruiter is going to take that as the ultimate resume piece.  
So the takeaway today is not just about tokens and how to make them, but how to get involved with communities in the technology world.
